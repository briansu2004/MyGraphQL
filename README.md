## My GraphQL Projects

### Project 1

Worked on a GraphQL SPA project for a Telecommunication client

- Used MongoDB as the NoSQL database and Mongoose as the object modeling tool.
- Implemented schema, queries, mutations and resolvers with Node.js on the backend and tested with GraphQL Studio.
- Utilized Angular on the front end with Apollo client GraphQL library.
- Deployed the web app to OpenShift cluster with Jenkins pipeline.
